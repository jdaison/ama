# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](https://github.com/flaviocopes/ama/issues/new)

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means anything. Work. Life. Code. Blogging. Whatever.

> You can ask anything but I might choose not to reply if I don't feel like ðŸ˜›

## Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Please don't ask me for help on your programming problems or tasks. Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow
- Be civil and polite.
